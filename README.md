I'm Nathan and these are my website files, just thought I'd do the readme for fun really, I'm a 
Techy guy from North East England, and I like to do stuff! I'm a bit of a jack of all trades
really, and what I like to do is make stuff really, I like to create and get visual feedback
from my work, I'm a bit of a perfectionist and I welcome feedback, obviously I go by don't be
A d*ck, but any criticisms of my work or if I come across negatively then please feel free to
comment, I did write all this not realizing of course there was a wrap dropdown and now I feel
slightly foolish, but enough of my ramblings, hopefully I'll soon be known as the empty website
guy and you can all come look at my silly first few attempts at actually doing stuff for myself!

Thanks for reading, I guess!

Nathan / Fakie.
